# Announcement

Due to LSPosed upstream not fixing the error for a long time, the git source goes to https://github.com/YT-Advanced/MagiskOnWSALocal.git

## ⚠️ Important Tips ⚠️ 

**If you don't read these tips, you and your family may be subjected to verbal abuse from me - this is disrespectful to the fruits of other people's labour**

Please do not Fork this repository, create one yourself and import the files.

Forking will cause the github action count of the repository you Forked to end up counting to the upstream repository and cause the upstream repository to be blocked, (that's how MagiskOnWSA got blocked)

## How it works

This project is based on a temporary clone of MagiskOnWSA and a direct call to build.sh to create the latest version and release it to Releases.

Click Watch - Custom - Publish New Version (Releases) to get an email notification when a new version is automatically built!

*Release attachments are built and uploaded by Github Action, feel free to review the [build.yml](https://github.com/yige-yigeren/MagiskOnWSAOnlineBuild/edit/main/.github/workflows/Build) source code and suggest changes.

*As for any better way to publish, please feel free to suggest.

Default settings:

Run once a week at 12:00 UTC on Fridays, automatically run after modifying the workflow file, and skip the release if the version number already exists.

Official release version: build parameters: stable version stable; with root access (Magisk); remove Google Play; remove Amazon store.

Pre-release version: build parameters: latest RP version; with root access (Magisk); remove Google Play; remove Amazon store.
